Symmetric Cryptography Library
--------------

This is the github repository for Ordo, a cryptography library with an emphasis on symmetric cryptography, which strives to meet high performance, portability, and security standards, while remaining modular in design to facilitate adding new features and fixing existing ones. The library is written in standard C, but some sections are assembly-optimized for performance.
