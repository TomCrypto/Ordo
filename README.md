Ordo
==============

Symmetric Cryptography Library
--------------

This is the github repository for Ordo, a minimalist cryptography library with an emphasis on symmetric cryptography, which strives to meet high performance, portability, and security standards, while remaining modular in design to facilitate adding new features and fixing existing ones. The library is written in standard C, but some sections are assembly-optimized for performance. Note that while the library is technically usable at this point, it is still a work in progress and must not be deployed in security-sensitive applications.
